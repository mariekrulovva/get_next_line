# Get Next Line (GNL)


This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: **static
variables**.
____
### Common Instructions
* Your project must be written in C.

* Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.

* Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.

* All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.

* If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

* Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.

* To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file _bonus.{c/h} if the subject does not specify anything else. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately.

* If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your project‚Äôs Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

* We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work **won‚Äôt have to be submitted and won‚Äôt be graded**. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peers‚Äô work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

* Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthought‚Äôs grading, the evaluation will stop.

### Function Prototype
```
char *get_next_line(int fd);
```
____
### GNL Mandatory Part

Function name | get_next_line
--- | ---
Prototype | char *get_next_line(int fd);
Turn in files | get_next_line.c, get_next_line_utils.c, get_next_line.h
Parameters | fd: The file descriptor to read from
Return value | Read line: correct behavior. NULL: there is nothing else to read, or an error occurred
External functs. | read, malloc, free
Description  | Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

* Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.

* Your function should return the line that was read.

* If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.

* Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.

* **Please note** that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

* Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the get_next_line() function.

* Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.

‚ÑπÔ∏è A good start would be to know what a *static variable* is.

* Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette
in order to test your code.
* You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
* We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didn‚Äôt reach the end of file.
* We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

üí° Does your function still work if the BUFFER_SIZE value is 9999? If it is 1? 10000000? Do you know why?  
	
‚ÑπÔ∏è Try to read as little as possible each time get_next_line() is called. If you encounter a new line, you have to return the current line. Don‚Äôt read the whole file and then process each line.

‚ùó Forbidden    
‚Ä¢ You are not allowed to use your libft in this project.    
‚Ä¢ lseek() is forbidden.    
‚Ä¢ Global variables are forbidden.

### GNL Bonus Part

This project is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt allow complex bonuses. However, we trust your creativity. If you completed the mandatory part, give a try to this bonus part.

Here are the bonus part requirements:
* Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
* Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time. For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.
    It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then
fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.

Append the _bonus.[c\h] suffix to the bonus part files.

It means that, in addition to the mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following
files:
* get_next_line_bonus.c
* get_next_line_bonus.h
* get_next_line_utils_bonus.c

‚ùóThe bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is PERFECT. Perfect means the mandatory part has been integrally done
and works without malfunctioning. If you have not passed ALL the mandatory requirements, your bonus part will not be evaluated at all.

### Functions Used

**External Functions**

  | Function | Description         |
 |-----------|-------------------------|
 |  read() | reads data previously written to a file |
 |  malloc() | used to allocate a block of memory on the heap |
 |  free() | to release or deallocate the memory blocks which are previously    allocated by calloc(), malloc() or realloc() functions |

**Utility Functions**

 | Function | Description         |
 |-----------|----------------------|
 |  ft_strnew() | Uses size as the size for a new string product of memalloc, this will return the new string, after assigning '' 0 "as elements of the string. |
 |  ft_strchr() | The  strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s. |
 |  ft_strjoin() | Allocates with malloc and returns a new string, which is the result of the concatenation of 's1' and 's2'. |
 |  ft_memdel() | A line has been read |
 |  ft_strdup() | Returns a pointer to a  new  string  which  is  a duplicate  of the string s. |
 |  ft_substr | Allocates with malloc and returns a substring from the string 's'. |
 |  ft_strlen |  Calculates the length of the string s, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0') |
